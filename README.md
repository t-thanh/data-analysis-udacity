Data Analyst Nanodegree is aimed to equip all the skills a data analyst need to conduct full, end-to-end analyses harnessing the power of Python, the leading industry programming language for data analysis.

## Modules:

### Module 1: Introduction to Data Analysis
- Learn how to create interactive, shareable data reports with Jupyter Notebooks
- Get set up with Anaconda, the leading package management & deployment solution for data science
- Investigate datasets using two of Pythonâ€™s most powerful data science libraries, NumPy & pandas

### Module 2: Practical Statistics
- Learn to apply key concepts like Simpson's Paradox, conditional probability, Bayes Theorem & more
- Explore various probability distributions and learn how they apply to hypothesis testing
- Practice conducting invaluable statistical techniques like A/B tests, multiple linear regression & logistic regression

### Module 3: Data Wrangling
- Gather data from multiple sources, including reading saved files, downloading from URLs, scraping web pages, and accessing data from APIs
- Identify data quality issues and use metrics to categorize them by validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity
- Clean data using Python and pandas and test your cleaning code visually and programmatically

### Module 4: Data Visualization with Python
- Understand various pitfalls that can impact the effectiveness and interpretability of visualizations
- Learn how to present data in a wide range of statistically-valid visualizations, including histograms, scatterplots, heatmaps, and more
- Learn how to customize almost any aspect of your visualizations (including how to present multiple variables at once)
